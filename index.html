                    <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Dekker and I live in Amsterdam. I'm currently 18 years old and in my last year of high school at the Metis Montessori Lyceum where I've been following a special coding programme for 6 years. In this programme I've made some very diverse projects ranging from websites to virtual reality and gaming. My main interest lies in machine learning and artificial intelligence, this is the field I'd like to study and work in after my education. I've also made a project exploring this. You can read about this projects and others on my page! You can also read about which coding languages and tools I'm experienced and you can contact me.</p>
